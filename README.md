# Python tutorials 
There are lots of python tutorials online. Following is a summary of the python turorials that help me a lot when I learn python. Hope they also help you. :)

1. **Basics & Overview**: [Stanford University CS41](http://stanfordpython.com/) <br/>
The tutorial is from Stanford CS41 happy code - the python programming language, though I dont think it is "happy". The tutorial is well prepared, and quite suitable for beginners. It will teach you the fundamentals and contemporay usage of Python, with a focus on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the language. It covers follwing topics: 
    * Python Fundamentals
    * Data Structures
    * Functions
    * Object Oriented Python
    * Standard Library
    * Third-Party Tools
    * Ecosystem
    * Advanced Topics 
    * Projects

2. **Numpy Tutorial**: [Staford CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) <br/>
The section is a **quick crash course** both on the pyhon programming language and on the use of Python for **scientific computing**.
It covers following contents:
    * Python (Basics, Containers, Functions, Classes)
    * Numpy 
    * Scipy
    * Matplotlib

3. **Pandas Tutorial**: [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)<br/>
This is a short introduction to pandas, geared mainly for new pandas users. It is a good beginning tutorial, will help you to be familar with pandas. The pandas library will be useful in data processing when doing real projects. You will see its power when attending Kaggle competitions. Here is a guide to [more pandas tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html). 

4. **Data Science with Python**: [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)<br/>
The tutorials are from the University of Michigan specialization, and there are 5 courses provided on coursera. It introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This specialization is for those who already have basic python background, and then apply **statistical**, **machine learning**, **information visualization**, **text analysis** and **social network analysis** techniques through popular python toolkits such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **scikit-learn**, **nltk**, and **network** to gain insight into the data. This is a quite good specialization, leading us to the data science world with python.
