# Python tutorials 
There are lots of python tutorials online. Following is a summary of the python turorials that help me a lot when I learn python. Hope they can also help you. :)

### 1. IDE Choice? 
 * [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): An excellent python IDE. For students, can apply for the [free professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). It has a lot of great features. For example, it supports [remote server connection](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-a-remote-server-configuration.html).

 * [Jupyter](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): Install the Anaconda 2.7 or 3.6, which will greatly help you manage you python libraries. 

### 2. Basics & Overview: [CS41](http://stanfordpython.com/) <br/>
The tutorial is from Stanford CS41 happy code - the python programming language, though I dont think it is "happy". The tutorial is well prepared, and quite suitable for beginners. It will teach you the fundamentals and contemporay usage of Python, with a focus on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the language. It covers follwing topics: 
* Python Fundamentals
* Data Structures
* Functions
* Object Oriented Python
* Standard Library
* Third-Party Tools
* Ecosystem
* Advanced Topics 
* Projects

### 3. Numpy: [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) <br/>
The section is a **quick crash course** both on the pyhon programming language and on the use of Python for **scientific computing**.
It covers following contents:
* Python (Basics, Containers, Functions, Classes)
* Numpy 
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

### 4. Pandas: 
Quickly check: [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).This is a short introduction to pandas, geared mainly for new pandas users. It is a good beginning tutorial, will help you to be familar with pandas. The pandas library will be useful in data processing when doing real projects. You will see its power when attending Kaggle competitions. Here is a guide to [more pandas tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html), and my own [pandas summary](https://github.com/zyunsg/Python/tree/master/pandas).

### 5. Cheat Sheets:<br/>
